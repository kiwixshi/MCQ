This is an MCQ Website prototype. The prototype has two different sections, one for the use of a student and the other for the use of a teacher. Teachers can view their existing live tests and also add new tests with the help of this website. A rich text editor is provided for the teachers to add upto 5 different options for a question, add an image for the question, edit questions and add multiple questions per test. Further, the teachers can specify the test name, the marks of the test and the amount of time the test is to be taken in once started. On the other hand, the students section allows students to attend the current live tests. The students have to complete the test within the stipulated countdown time provided in the corner of the page. Once the student has completed the test, the test will no longer be valid and will be removed from the tests view.
